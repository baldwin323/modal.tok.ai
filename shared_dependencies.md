The shared dependencies between "merge_commits.py" and "generate_readme.py" could include:

1. GitPython: This is a Python library used to interact with Git repositories. Both scripts would need this to interact with the repository, merge commits, and generate a readme based on the commit history.

2. Repository Path: This is a shared variable that represents the path to the local Git repository. Both scripts would need this to know where to operate.

3. Commit History: This is a shared data schema that represents the history of commits in the repository. The "merge_commits.py" script would generate this after merging all commits, and the "generate_readme.py" script would use this to generate the readme.

4. README File Path: This is a shared variable that represents the path to the readme file in the local repository. The "generate_readme.py" script would need this to know where to write the readme.

5. Merge Function: This is a shared function that merges all commits in the repository. It would be defined in "merge_commits.py" and used in "generate_readme.py" to ensure that all commits are merged before the readme is generated.

6. Generate Readme Function: This is a shared function that generates a readme based on the commit history. It would be defined in "generate_readme.py" and used in "merge_commits.py" to generate the readme after all commits are merged.
