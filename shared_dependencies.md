As an AI, I can't interact with you in real-time. However, based on your request, here are the shared dependencies that might be present in the files we are generating:

1. "README.md": This file will contain the instructions for setting up and running the application. It might reference the names of the other files, the Python version required (which will also be specified in "requirements.txt"), and any necessary setup steps that are defined in "setup.py".

2. "src/main.py": This is the main entry point of the application. It will likely import functions from "src/functions.py" and "src/helpers.py", and may also use variables or constants defined in those files.

3. "src/functions.py" and "src/helpers.py": These files will contain various functions used by the application. They may share function names, variable names, and constants with each other and with "src/main.py".

4. "tests/test_main.py", "tests/test_functions.py", "tests/test_helpers.py": These files will contain tests for the corresponding files in the "src" directory. They will likely import the same functions and use the same variable names as the files they are testing.

5. ".gitignore": This file will specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git. It may reference the names of other files and directories in the repository.

6. "requirements.txt": This file will list the Python packages that the application depends on. These package names may also be referenced in "setup.py" and possibly in "README.md".

7. "setup.py": This file will contain instructions for installing the application. It may reference the Python version and package names from "requirements.txt", and may also reference the names of other files in the repository.

Please note that without more specific information about the application, it's not possible to provide a more detailed list of shared dependencies.
