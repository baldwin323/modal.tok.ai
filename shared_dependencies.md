Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files we are generating could include:

1. **GitPython**: This is a Python library used to interact with Git repositories. It's likely used in all the Python files to pull erased or unmerged files from different branches.

2. **os and sys libraries**: These are standard Python libraries for interacting with the system, likely used in all the Python files for file and directory operations.

3. **unittest library**: This is a Python library for testing, likely used in the test.py file.

4. **retrieve_files function**: This function is likely defined in retrieve_files.py and used in main.py and test.py to retrieve all possible options (files) for testing.

5. **merge_files function**: This function is likely defined in merge_files.py and used in main.py and test.py to merge any unmerged files.

6. **erase_files function**: This function is likely defined in erase_files.py and used in main.py and test.py to erase any files if necessary.

7. **branch files**: These are likely Python files representing different branches of the project. They might contain different versions of the same functions or variables, which are used in main.py and test.py for testing.

8. **branch_name variable**: This variable is likely used in all the branch files, main.py, and test.py to identify the branch.

9. **file_list variable**: This variable is likely used in main.py, test.py, and all the utility files (retrieve_files.py, merge_files.py, erase_files.py) to store the list of files to be tested.

10. **test_results variable**: This variable is likely used in main.py and test.py to store the results of the tests.

Please note that without the actual code, these are educated guesses based on the user's prompt and the file names. The actual shared dependencies might be different.
