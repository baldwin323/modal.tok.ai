Shared Dependencies:

1. User Data Schema: This is a shared data structure that defines the user's information. It is used in "user_interface.py", "access_features.py", "user_authentication.py", and "user_base_handling.py".

2. Feature Data Schema: This data structure defines the app's features. It is used in "access_features.py" and "performance_optimization.py".

3. DOM Element IDs: These are identifiers for HTML elements that JavaScript functions will interact with. Common IDs might include "userLogin", "userLogout", "accessFeature", used across both mobile and web interfaces.

4. Message Names: These are identifiers for different types of messages that the system might need to handle. Examples could include "loginSuccess", "loginFailure", "featureAccessed", used in "user_interface.py", "access_features.py", and "user_authentication.py".

5. Function Names: These are identifiers for functions that are used across multiple files. Examples could include "loginUser()", "logoutUser()", "accessFeature()", used in both mobile and web interfaces, and "encryptData()", "authenticateUser()", used in security files.

6. Encryption Key: This is a shared variable used in "data_encryption.py" and "user_authentication.py" for encrypting and decrypting user data.

7. Privacy Regulations: These are shared rules used in "privacy_compliance.py" and "user_authentication.py" to ensure the app complies with privacy laws.

8. Performance Metrics: These are shared variables used in "performance_optimization.py" and "user_base_handling.py" to monitor and optimize the app's performance.
