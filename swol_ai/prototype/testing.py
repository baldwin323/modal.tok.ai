```python
import unittest
from swol_ai.prototype.merge import merged_code

class TestPrototype(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.merged_code = merged_code

    def test_prototype(self):
        """
        Perform thorough testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues.
        """
        # Add your specific tests here based on the requirements and user flows
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This is a basic structure for the testing file. The actual tests will depend on the specific requirements, user flows, and features of the prototype.
