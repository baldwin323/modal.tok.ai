# Prerequisites

Before we start setting up our cross-platform testing environment, ensure that you have the following:

- A Windows machine with the latest version of Windows OS installed. This will be used for Windows and Android testing.

- A macOS machine for iOS testing. Ensure that it is updated to the latest version of macOS.

- An Android device or emulator for Android testing. If you're using an emulator, ensure that it is capable of running the latest version of Android OS.

Please note that the setup instructions for each platform will be provided in the respective files: "steps/installation.md" for software installation, "steps/setup_virtual_env.md" for setting up the virtual environment, and "steps/install_dependencies.md" for installing the necessary dependencies.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can proceed with the setup and testing process as outlined in the "setup_instructions.md" file.
