# Device-Specific Testing

In this step, we will conduct additional testing on different devices within each platform to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes, resolutions, and hardware configurations.

## Windows Testing

1. Test the app on different versions of Windows (Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, etc.).
2. Test the app on different screen resolutions (1366x768, 1920x1080, 2560x1440, etc.).
3. Test the app on different hardware configurations (different CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.).

## iOS Testing

1. Test the app on different iOS devices (iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, etc.).
2. Test the app on different iOS versions (iOS 13, iOS 14, etc.).
3. Test the app on different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Android Testing

1. Test the app on different Android devices (Samsung Galaxy S10, Google Pixel 4, etc.).
2. Test the app on different Android versions (Android 9 Pie, Android 10, Android 11, etc.).
3. Test the app on different screen sizes and resolutions.

Remember to document any issues or bugs encountered during this testing phase. Refer to the [Testing and Bug Fixing](./testing_bug_fixing.md) document for more information on how to handle these issues.
