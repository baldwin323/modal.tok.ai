\# Set Up Virtual Environments

In this step, we will create a virtual environment for our project using the `venv` module in Python. This will help isolate dependencies and ensure a clean testing environment.

Here are the steps to create a virtual environment:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

3. Create a virtual environment. Replace `env` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows, use:

```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, use:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Now, you are in the virtual environment. You can confirm this by checking that the name of your virtual environment appears in parentheses at the start of your terminal prompt.

To exit the virtual environment, you can use the `deactivate` command.

Remember, you should always activate your virtual environment before you start working on your project and deactivate it when you're done.
